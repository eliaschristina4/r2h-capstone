# Capstone Final Project

This repository was created with the task given to each of our group members of collaborating to put together a Capstone project, inside of our participating tech program, Road To Hire. We were given instructions to create a full-stack application utilizing front-end & back-end technologies, in order to develop something that follows in the philanthropic footsteps of our employee partners.

For this assignment, we came up with the idea to create an application for Bank of America, in order to help small businesses connect with mentors and bridge the gap between loan lending and business funding. Mentors can sign-up and list their business interests, as well as businesses having the option to list their interests, which they are then matched with one another to help progress toward financial growth through the use of company-issued & 3rd party grants. We have a sign-up sheet for our business/business owners that take:
**Business Name**
**Owner Full Name**
**Business Description**
**Business Interests** _(What the company/mentor specializes in or tends to focus on in their practice)_
**Email Address**
**Phone Number**
**Password**
**Confirm Password**

This form also doubles as a sign-up form for our mentors as well. When clicking “Sign up as a Mentor” down below, it takes you to a new sign-up sheet where the first 3 sections are now labeled as:
**Full Name**
**Profession**
**Mentor Description** _(What they’re passionate to help people do and or achieve in their line of work/business)_

***

Once registered and logged in as either a business owner or mentor, our user is then able to utilize our resources & mentors pages with the purpose of connecting to someone who may serve as a financial advisor, or someone who is in need of financial advising. From this point, our user is connected to either a business owner or mentor to then collaborate further on future steps to their funding timeline, as well as finding different resources and grants to apply to, and making sure they are both aligned with the same interests in the long run.
